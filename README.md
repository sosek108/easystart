Easy Start Project
===============

Simple project which is boilerplate for even simpler sites written in HTML/CSS/JS.

First run
---------
* `` npm install ``
* `` gulp init ``

Fancy stuff inside
------------------
1. ``npm`` with ``gulp``
2. ``PostCSS``

Requirements
------------
1. Of course ``node`` for ``npm``

Should I add routing behaviour?
